<p><em>"I damn like to call myself special, and believe I'm supposed to have all honours. This makes me feel bad for whenever I am not in the spotlight.<br>Now, it seems to me that... I am not the 'chosen one', far from it. I wasn't supposed to change the world. There are a hell a lot of people better than me in any field.<br>Thinking always overwhelms me. It never fails to waste my time. It's a vicious cycle. Once you're into it, there's no way out.<br>I once thought to force myself, and I do try, to feel positive, and look at all good aspects of life... But it's just harder to neglect all negativity."</em> - whmsft</p>
