- I'm a 15-year-old who likes talking about the United Kingdom, Geopolitics, AI, Technology, Maps, News and stuff.

- I have really strong controversial opinions. I stand strongly with Israel no matter what. I terribly dislike all religions, Islam and Hinduism the most (even though the latter is my own religion, but I don't believe in such faiths)

- I'm currently working on ~~**[WhirlEdit](https://github.com/whmsft/whirledit)**~~ ~~**[PopUP](https://github.com/whmsft/popup)**~~ and on my ~~new~~ game: ~~**[vechTen](https://github.com/whmsft/vechten)**~~ and also on ~~[experiments](https://github.com/whmsft/experiments)~~ Just relaxing and doing nothing...

- In the future, I dream of joining in as a Data Scientist @ Microsoft (MSFT, thus my username's last 4 chars)

- wanna contact me? email me at  whmsft@outlook.com

- Fun Fact: My birthday is on the 18th of July, That's the founding day of Intel! (Intel is exactly 40 years older than me)

- I can understand Dutch and German too, but not fluent in any of them.
